Computing Fibonacci Numbers Using OpenMP Tasks

Task Description: Write a C program that calculates the Fibonacci sequence using a recursive function. The recursive function should be parallelized using OpenMP tasks to improve performance.

Requirements:

Implement a recursive function to calculate Fibonacci numbers.

Use OpenMP to parallelize the computation by creating tasks.

Ensure that small Fibonacci numbers (e.g., num <= 10) are computed sequentially to reduce overhead.

Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms to avoid data races.

The program should take an integer num as input and output F(num) 

Hints: 

Use #pragma omp task to create tasks for recursive calls.

Use #pragma omp taskwait to synchronize tasks.
